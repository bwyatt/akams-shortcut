# Faster aka.ms
A tiny browser extension to use `aka.ms` short URLs even faster, for maximum laziness. _Save 5 whole keystrokes!_

_TODO: Add Edge and Chrome store links_

## How to Use It

Type `a` and press `space` or `tab`, then type the shortcut you want (the part after `https://aka.ms/`), and finally press enter. Through the magic of Javascript, you will be transported, Narnia-like, to the short URL of your specification.

_TODO: Add a screenshot or gif_

> **Note:** Because there's no intelligence in this extension, it must rely on yours. If you make a typo or specify a shortcut that doesn't exist, you won't end up where you wanted.

## But Why, Though?

This extension is very silly. I know. But Microsoft employees hand out `aka.ms` URLs like candy, and this is an extremely trivial time saver for us. 

Honestly, I made this weird little thing for two reasons: (1) I really am lazy enough to want to type `aka.ms/` less often and (2) I wanted to learn how to make a browser extension.

## Credit

This project was inspired by (and its icons gratuitously copied from) the excellent, actually useful, and far more technically impressive [cmd.ms](https://cmd.ms) by [Merill Fernando](https://github.com/merill).
